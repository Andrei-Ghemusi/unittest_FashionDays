# FashionDays testing with unittest library

In this project I will be testing certain aspects of FashionDays web page using unittest library.

Site tested: https://www.fashiondays.ro/

Project structure:
- package called 'authentication_page' which contains:
    -  'positive_authentication_tests' which contains functional positive tests ran on the authentication page;
    -  'negative_authentication_tests' which contains functional negative tests ran on the authentication page;
    -  'authentication_page_non_functional_tests' which contains non functional testing using Google Ligthouse testing tool;
  
- package called 'main_page' which contains:
    -  'positive_main_page_tests' which contains functional positive tests ran on the main page;
    -  'negative_main_page_tests' which contains functional negative tests ran on the main page;
    -  'main_page_non_functional_tests' which contains non functional testing using Google Ligthouse testing tool;
 
- package called 'newsletter_functionality' which contains:
    -  'positive_newsletter_tests' which contains functional positive tests regarding the newsletter functionality;
    -  'negative_newsletter_tests' which contains functional negative tests regarding the newsletter functionality;

- package called 'search functionality' which contains:
    -  'positive_search functionality_tests' which contains functional positive tests regarding the search functionality;
    -  'negative_search functionality_tests' which contains functional negative tests regarding the search functionality;
 
- directory called 'reports' which contains the HTML reports generated by HTMLTestRunner and Google Lighthouse;
- python file called 'setup' which contains classes whose role is to establish the 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods
- python file called 'suite' which contains the test suite whose role is to run the entire project and generate an HTML report
- python file called 'utility_methods' which contains the methods used throughout the project

Libraries and packages used:
- unittest;
- selenium;
- webdriver_manager;
- pytest;
- time;
- subprocess
- os
- ActionChains
- HtmlTestRunner. ***This one might not work to pip install, if that's the case, the search for 'html-testRunner' in python packages then install it***

How to run the project:
- in 'suites' file, press the green arrow on the side of the class to run the whole project;
- press the green arrow on the side of any method to only run that specific test.


ERRORS/BUGS/FAILURES/RECOMMENDED CHANGES
- The performance and accessibility of the website is quite lacking, this needs to be adressed
- On the search bar, inputting nothing then pressing enter refreshes the page, but it does not display any message, I would recommend that a message as such "you need to enter a product name" is implemented is case the customer presses enter or clicks on the search icon, while having to written input in the search bar.
- Price filter: when setting the price filter setting the drag and drop at the very end makes the filter to be set on 0 (in the code), but not visually, additionally, because selenium acts so fast while setting the drag and drop at 0, the visual price still remains at the max.
  
  # !! REMINDER !!
  Some tests are run on certain timed campaigns and promotions, so when they expire the test will automatically enter 'except'.f
